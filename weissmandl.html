          <h2>Rav Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl</h2>
          <div class="weissmandl-img"><img src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/photos.geni.com/p13/18/b3/39/03/534448421210d696/weismandel_medium.jpg  " alt="Rabbi Moshe Feinstein" height="250"></div> 
          <p>Rav Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl, known as Reb Michoel Ber, was born in Hungary. Already as a young child, he learned much Torah and was able to understand Seforim and learning as if he were an adult. Later Rav Michoel Ber became a Rabbi and Rosh Yeshiva.
            During the time of World War II, Hitler (Yimach Shemo) was very, very wicked and tried to wipe out all of the Jews. He put them into camps and made them work very hard. They were taken on trains to the camps where they were guarded by police so they could not escape. 
            One dreary day, Rav Michoel Ber was captured by the Nazi police (who were Hitler’s y”s soldiers). He was taken on the train and guarded. Rav Michoel Ber knew he had to escape so he could help save Jews from this sad event. While the train was still moving, Rav Michoel Ber jumped off the train. The soldiers wondered where he went but couldn’t find him. Rav Michoel Ber dedicated his life to saving thousands of
            Jews from Hitler (y”s). He loved every Jew!</p>
