            The Bluzhever Rebbe</h2>

            Rabbi Yisroel Spira became the Rabbi of a community in Galicia when he was a young man. As time went by, people heard of his good deeds. He attracted many followers who became his Chassidim.
            Then Hitler (Y”S) came to power and wanted to kill all the Jews. His wicked, evil soldiers took the Jews to a concentration camp called Bergen Belsen. The Rebbe worked very hard to help the Jews there. Soon everyone in the camp treated him as their Rebbe. One year as Chanukah approached, the people in
            Bergen Belsen realized that they had no candles or oil for their Chanukah Menorah. They did not want to miss the mitzvah of hadlakas ner Chanukah, so they took shoe polish to use for oil and strings from their clothing to use for wicks. When the first night of Chanukah came, everyone gathered quietly around the Bluzhever Rebbe to watch him light the Menorah. They were all terrified that the Nazis might find them and punish them. The Rebbe said the brachos and lit the menorah. Since it was the first night of  Chanukah, the Bluzhever Rebbe said the bracha, Shehechiyanu, thanking Hashem who kept them alive to experience that moment. Everyone answered Amen to the Rebe’s bracha except one man who was upset he asked the Rebbe, “How can you say a bracha thanking Hashem for this moment when we are so hungry and scared and living in a concentration camp?” The Rebbe answered him, “I also was wondering how I could say this bracha with simcha, but when I looked around and saw all these people who risked their lives to see this menorah I became very happy. I said thank you Hashem, Shehechiyanu, who had kept me alive to see the greatness of the Jewish people. They never give up; even in the concentration camps they want to do Mitzvos. Surely these people will get out of here one day and rebuild their lives.” Many years later, the man who asked the question sent the Bluzhever Rebbe a message. He said, “Rebbe, you saved my life.” After the war, the Bluzhever Rebbe moved to America. In America he spent the rest of his life helping other people who survived the camps start their lives over. </p>
