          <h2>Rav Chaim Ozer Grodzensky</h2>
          <div class="grodzenky-img"><img src= "http://photos.geni.com/p13/b6/bb/a0/e7/53444844030b4710/rebchaimozer2_original.jpg" alt="Rabbi Moshe Feinstein" height="250"></div> 
          <p>Rav Chaim Ozer for many years was the Chief Rabbi of the city of Vilna. He took upon himself personal responsibility to support the yeshivas in Lithuania and Poland. They all turned to him for advice and they recognized him as their leader. When Hitler (Y”S) began his war against the Jewish people,
            thousands of people turned to Rav Chaim Ozer for help and direction. He called all of the yeshivas to join him in Vilna.  In Vilna, he worked very hard to help the Jews that were running from Hitler (Y”S). Many people were saved with the help of Rav Chaim Ozer. Rav Chaim Ozer loved the yeshivas and talmidei chachamaim. He also felt a responsibility to help every single Jew in any way that he could. One year, three weeks before Pesach, a young nonreligious Jew, who was head of the Jewish socialist organization in the University of Vilna, received a message. Rav Chaim Ozer wanted to see him.When he arrived he was warmly greeted by the rabbi who invited him to join him in some cake and tea. I will make the beracha, he said to his secular guest, and all you have to do is say Amen. He then got to the point. Pesach is drawing near and there are many hundreds of Jewish students in the university who will not be at a Pesach Seder. If I make a Seder for these irreligious students hardly anyone will come. But if you, as head of the socialists make one, you will get a big crowd. I will supply you with all the money you need to see that everyone who wishes to be at the Seder will have matzah and maror and four cups of wine. There were a thousand students at that Seder! </p>
