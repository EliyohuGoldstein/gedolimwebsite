            The Vilna Gaon</h2>

          <p>Rabbi Eliyahu Ben Shlomo is known to Jews around the world as the Vilna Gaon. This is because he was a Gaon (Great) and he lived in the city called Vilna. When the Vilna Gaon was a
little boy, he was already a Talmud Chocham. By the time he was Bar Mitzvah, he knew more Torah than many Jews older than himself.
He grew up to be the greatest Talmud Chacham in the world. He explained many difficult things in the Torah that no one had ever been able to explain before. The people of Vilna loved and respected their Rabbi, the Vilna Gaon. The Vilna Gaon wanted to move to Eretz Yisroel because Eretz Yisroel was the home of the Jewish people. One day he finally decided to go. He packed his bags and got on the ship to begin the long trip to Eretz Yisroel. Suddenly, a gigantic storm came.
The ship was tossed under the water and could not go on. The ship came back to the port and the Vilna Gaon got off and went back to Vilna. He understood that Hashem had sent the storm to tell him to stay in Vilna and help the people there. As the Vilna Gaon did more and more Mitzvos and learned more and more Torah, the Kedusha of being close to Hashem started to show in his face. One time, some bad men grabbed a Jewish boy and they were going to hurt him. Wearing his tallis and tefillin, the Vilna Gaon went to save the boy. When he came to where the bad men were, he said, “Let him go.” When the bad men looked at the Vilna Gaon and saw the Kedusha that was on him as he wore his tallis and tefillin, they got so scared that they ran away and never came back. </p>
