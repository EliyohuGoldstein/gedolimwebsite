          <h2>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein</h2>
          <div class="feinstein-img"><img src= "https://torahdownloads.com/assets/speakers/248.jpg" alt="Rabbi Moshe Feinstein" height="250"></div> 
          <p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein was one of the greatest Jews that ever lived in this
            country. He knew all of the Torah (much of it by heart). People came to him from all around the world to ask him what to do and how to live according to the Torah and he always helped them. Reb Moshe lived to be a very old man and he was very respected by Jews everywhere. But, Reb Moshe never thought he was too great to help another person. 
            One time, a few days before Succos, the old shamash in Reb Mosheâ€™s yeshiva was building a Succah. He was having a problem putting up the schach. The shamash came to Reb Moshe and asked him if he could send some yeshiva bachurim to help him put up the schach. Instead of asking bachurim to help put up the schach, Reb Moshe took a ladder, climbed up and put on the schach himself. What a valuable lesson we learn from the great Reb Moshe Feinstein.</p>
